### Project Title
Post Your Work on Github

### Description
This project is about sharing a Python program I created to Github. The program analyzes bikeshare data for three cities in the United States. A user would answer three questions to choose the **city**, **month**, and **day** for analysis. _**All** can be selected for **month** and **day**_

Once the questions are answered the program displays statistics for:

*  Most popular times of travel
    *  Month
    *  Day of week
    *  Start time
    
*  Most popular stations and trip
    *  Start station
    *  End Station
    *  Trip  _Combination of start station and end station_
    
*  Trip duration
    *  Total  _Displayed in hours_
    *  Average  _Displayed in minutes_
    
*  User statistics
    *  User type
    *  Gender
    *  Oldest
    *  Youngest
    *  Most Common Age
    
_The retrieval of information for each section is timed._

Once the statistics are displayed the user then has the option of viewing the raw data in five line increments. 

### Files used
bikeshare.py

_The .csv files have not been pushed to GitHub because they are large files._
